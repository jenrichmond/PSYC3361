This is an opportunity to apply your new-found R skills and to learn about the challenges of open data and reproducible analysis. You will set your own challenge and then work together to complete it. You might not learn the exact functions that you will need to deal with your data problem in coding, so there will be a lot of TROUBLESHOOTING. But many hands make light work and learning R together works a little bit like these caterpillars.\n\n\nA group of caterpillars, moving in a formation known as a rolling swarm. This rolling swarm of caterpillars moves faster than any single caterpillar. 🐛 pic.twitter.com/sn3J3CDYmE\n\n— Theo Shantonas (@TheoShantonas) April 9, 2021\n\nWe will talk about what makes a team work well in class and this component of the course will be graded by peer and self assessment. You will rate your own and others contribution to the project using criteria that you decide on as a team.\n2. Research Skills (10%)\nIn the first 3 weeks of term, you will work through online coding lessons that will set you up well to complete your reproducibility challenge. Danielle has set up a RStudioCloud workspace and posted YouTube videos talk you through the basics of RMarkdown, Data Visualisation, and Data Wrangling.\nIt will be your responsibility to watch them, follow along with the exercises and think hard about how the functions you are learning about might be useful in your project. From Week 4 you will start applying the code you are learning to your reproducibility challenge.\nFrom Week 4, there will be two Q&A sessions each week. These are an opportunity to work together with your team in a computer lab, with course staff there to answer your questions. We recommend you attend one or both Q&A sessions. You will likely learn a lot both from asking about the problems you are having and from seeing the kinds of problems that other students are having.\nFor this component of the course, you need to share a learning log to RPubs each week. The learning log should include a reflection of…\nWhat were your coding goals this week?\nHow did you go achieving your goals (challenges/successes)?\nWhat the next steps are in your coding journey?\nYou can see an example learning log in this blog post. You should include example code/plots in your learning log as a way of sharing your progress with your team and Jenny/Kate/Danielle. Post a link to your RPubs learning to the slack channel by 11:59pm Sunday each week.\n3. Presentation (30%)\nIn Week 8, your group will present the outcome of your verification challenge to the class. You can choose whether you would like to present live or prerecord your talk. Each team member should be involved in the presentation. Your 10 min talk should include…\nsome background (what the research was about, what they found)\nan overview of your plan (what did you intend to reproduce)\na discussion of how you went (what were the challenges/triumphs)\na take away message (what did you learn about reproducibility, what recommendations would you make to the authors of this paper for next time)\nThere will be time for Q&A after each talk.\n4. Verification report (50%)\nPart 1: Reaction\nThe goal of this section is to demonstrate that you have read and really thought about the paper. Write a short summary explaining the context of the research question, the methodology, the results, and the conclusions. Structure your summary around answering these questions; write in paragraphs (3 or 4 should be sufficient), not in Q and A format.\nwhat is the research problem?\nwhy it is important?\nwhat is the gap in the literature that the paper fills?\nwhat did the researchers do?\nwhat did they find?\nwhat does it mean?\nThen choose 3 of the following statements to guide your reaction to the paper. For each statement, write 3-4 sentences (150-200 words) explaining your point.\nI was surprised that…\nI can see that this paper relates to…\nThe paper reminded me of…\nI was confused by…\nIt seems that the next step in this area of research would be to…\nThe authors seem to have missed…\nThe most interesting part of this paper was…\nWhen I was reading I was excited to learn that…\nI wonder whether…\nFuture work in this area needs to consider…\nI wasn’t convinced that…\nThe evidence for the claim that… seemed…\nThe logic of the rationale was [compelling, flawed, confusing, unclear] because…\nI’m not sure that I understood why…\nThe take home message that I am left with after reading this paper is…\nPart 2: Verification\nThe goal of this section is to try and reproduce the “analysis”. For the purpose of this exercise, “analysis” includes the\ndemographic descriptives\nmeans/SD reported in the text\nfigures in the paper\nWARNING: This task is unlikely to be easy but you will work on it in groups. In this section of your report you should document YOUR process and what YOU learned along the way. The writing doesn’t have to be scientific or formal; think of it as notes to your future self or explaining your code to a Rubber Duck (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). Someone who has no idea what your code is trying to do should be able to read your notes and understand what the code is doing and why.\nPart 3: Exploration\nOpen data is reusable and can be used to answer research questions that are different to those posed by the researchers who collected it. The goal of this section is allow you to “play” with the data and demonstrate some creativity and critical thinking skills. Now that you have tried to reproduce the analysis in the paper, what questions do you have about the data set? Use your data wrangling/plotting skills to ask and answer 3 additional questions.\nPart 4: Recommendation\nThe goal of this section is to give imaginary feedback to the authors of the paper you have tried to reproduce. Use the reproducibility checklist to make recommendations for things they could have done to make your job easier.\nYou can use this example verification report as a model for the style that you should be aiming for. You can see the Rmd file that produced the roaches report here.\n\n\n\n",

There are no lectures, no tutorials, and no exam. There is no “content” for you to know by the end of the session. You are entirely responsible for your own learning; the more you put in, the more you will get out of this experience. It is a unique opportunity to really use your brain.\nPSYC3361 is designed to be a hands-on research experience, but this year we are not going to do that in the lab. We are going to build the course around open data, giving you the opportunity to learn skills that are critical for conducting reproducible research.\nBy the end of the course you will…\nbe able to explain why it is important that scientists are transparent about their research practices\nbe able to use your understanding of structural, ethical and practical barriers to explain describe why some researchers share their data and others don’t\nbe able to describe the factors make research analyses more or less difficult to reproduce\nbe able to apply workflow practices to your own projects in a way that will make transparency and data sharing easy\nknow enough R to produce descriptive statistics and visualisations in your honours project\nIt is a bit of a an experiment so we want you to let us know how it is going as we go along. Use this anonymous/editable document at any time to let us know what is working and what is not working.\nThere will be lots of feedback but no marks (until the end)\nThe assessment for this course is designed to allow you to engage in activities that research students and academics consider part of their “job” (reading critically, writing code, dealing with data, presenting their work, writing reports, giving feedback to peers, reflecting on their research process). We will give you all Ds and HDs (provided you complete all components and give your best effort), so the numbers don’t actually matter. You can read more about the grading philosophy for the course in this blog post.\nPlease come prepared… it doesn’t work if you don’t\nThe workshops run in flipped mode, much like elective classes in honours. In the first workshop of the term, Kate and I will do most of the talking, but after that the rest of the workshops will be run by you. There will be prep work to do (something to read, watch and/or write) before you arrive. If you do the work, you will be able to contribute to the discussion and engage in the activities. If you haven’t done what has been assigned for that week, you will let your classmates down.\nThe Schedule\nThis is the plan.\n\n\nweek <- c(1:10)\ncoding <-

There are some good reasons why people do this, mostly because they are user friendly and convenient tools. However, there are some disadvantages to these tools and in this part of the course I will introduce you to a simple way to write scientific documents in plain text files, using a convention known as “markdown”. I’ll first explain why markdown is such a useful approach to writing documents, and then introduce an extension called “R markdown” that allows you to incorporate data analysis code into the document itself. As a side benefit, knowledge of R markdown is useful for other professional purposes: this website, for example, is written using R markdown!\nThe resources for this section are online. There’s a set of slides you can browse, and a pre-recorded YouTube playlist that will guide you through them:\nR markdown slides\nYouTube playlist\nIf you have any questions or if something doesn’t work please feel free to message me on the class slack!\n\n\n\n",
