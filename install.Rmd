We use RStudio Cloud in the first few weeks of this course because it is the fastest and most pain-free way to get started with R. All you need is internet connection and you can get an RStudio interface that has a functional project set up with packages preinstalled. 

If you are really practicing your coding though, sometime in Week 2 or 3 you will run out of free hours on your RStudio Cloud. Congratulations! It is time to upgrade to working in RStudio on your own machine. 

Danielle has made a [series of videos here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRPB0ZzEYegOZivdelOuEn-R-XUN-DOjd) that walk you through the process of installing R and RStudio, no matter your machine set up.
