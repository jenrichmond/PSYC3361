The final section comes in two parts. It discusses reading data from and writing data to a CSV file, and introduces the pipe. Much of this section is devoted to a discussion of calculating descriptive statistics in R. The resources:

The second part provides an introduction to data wrangling in R, mostly focusing on dplyr. Topics covered include: extracting a subset of the data, rearranging the data, computing new variables in a data set, merging multiple data sets, and pivoting data between "long" and "wide" forms. Resources:
